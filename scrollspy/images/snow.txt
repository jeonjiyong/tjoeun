LAYER LIKE A PRO

Marty’s kit keeps him agile by evenly distributing his gear throughout his outer layer, insulated midlayer and bibs. Strategically placed pockets hold his equipment while keeping it accessible, so he can quickly stash his gloves, swap out foggy goggles and minimize his transition time before dropping in.
